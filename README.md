# SkillSwap

## Inspiration

In a world where knowledge is power, we wanted to create a platform where people could *exchange* it instead of just consuming it. The idea of learning from real humans across the globe — casually, skill-by-skill — felt simple yet powerful. We were inspired by how even small skills (like cooking a recipe or editing a video) can create value when shared. And so, **SkillSwap** was born: a space to teach, learn, and grow — together.

## What it does

SkillSwap lets users post the skills they can teach and the ones they want to learn. The app automatically matches users with others who have complementary skill sets. It also features live search, a random match button, light/dark mode, and data persistence using localStorage. The goal is to create a fun, accessible way for people around the world to connect and exchange knowledge on any topic.

## How we built it

We built SkillSwap using the Bolt.new platform with pure vibe-coding magic. The app consists of a responsive front-end interface with dynamic skill cards, matchmaking logic, local data storage, search filtering, UI theming, and animations. Every feature was added carefully to balance utility and simplicity within limited coding prompts.

## Challenges we ran into

The biggest challenge was working under strict prompt limits. Each feature had to be planned precisely and described clearly to make the most out of every generated block of code. Also, combining multiple interactive features like search, matching, and theme toggling while maintaining clean UI and responsiveness took some trial and error.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We're proud that we created a full-featured app that feels intuitive and looks clean — all within tight constraints. SkillSwap isn't just functional, it's something that people can actually use and enjoy. The automatic matchmaking and persistent data storage felt especially rewarding to implement under time pressure.

## What we learned

We learned how important it is to break down big ideas into focused, buildable chunks. This hackathon pushed us to think more clearly about UI, user flow, and how to communicate intent efficiently. It also showed us how much can be done with minimal tools when paired with thoughtful planning and a little creativity.

## What's next for SkillSwap

We'd love to evolve SkillSwap into a full-scale platform where users can chat, set up learning sessions, and build community profiles. Features like location-based filtering, badges for active teachers, or even an AI pairing assistant could help take it to the next level. For now, SkillSwap is a strong starting point — and we're excited about what it could grow into.
